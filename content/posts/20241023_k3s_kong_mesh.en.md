Kong Mesh is a platform designed to simplify service mesh management, enabling secure and efficient communication between microservices. It provides features such as security, observability, and traffic control, and uses a sidecar architecture to proxy communication between services. Supporting both Kubernetes and VMs, it enables unified network management across different environments. This allows developers to focus on their applications and reduces operational complexity.

This article is a memo on how to deploy Kong Mesh and use its policies.

## Preparing the K8s Environment

Any standard k8s environment will work, but here I use k3s.

```bash
export INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--tls-san <ip address> --write-kubeconfig ~/.kube/config --write-kubeconfig-mode 644"
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

If you add something like `INSTALL_K3S_CHANNEL=v1.24.4+k3s1` before `sh`, you can specify the version to install. If omitted, the latest version will be installed.

```zsh
kubectl get node
NAME          STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
wenhan-demo   Ready    control-plane,master   5m56s   v1.30.4+k3s1
```

## Deploying Kong Mesh

This time, we'll deploy a simple Single Zone setup.

### Kumactl

kumactl is a CLI tool for managing Kong Mesh and Kuma, making it easy to configure and operate service meshes. With CLI commands, you can deploy meshes, set policies, and monitor resources.
Follow these steps to install `kumactl` and add it to your `PATH`.
If you omit the VERSION, the latest version will be installed.

```bash
curl -L https://docs.konghq.com/mesh/installer.sh | VERSION=2.8.2 sh -

cd kong-mesh-2.8.2/bin
export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
```

### Kong Mesh Control Plane

Deploy the Kong Mesh Control Plane on k8s with the following command. This is the first time we use kumactl. It generates the necessary CRDs for installation.
Set the path to your license file (the same as Kong Gateway) with `--license-path`.

```bash
kumactl install control-plane \
    --license-path=/home/ubuntu/license | kubectl apply -f -
```

After deployment, the `kong-mesh-control-plane-xxxxx` Pod will be in Running state, and the `default` mesh will be deployed.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kong-mesh-system
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kong-mesh-control-plane-5d5cb5f55c-h59wb   1/1     Running   0          24s

kubectl get meshes
NAME      AGE
default   2m20s
```

You can access the Kong Mesh Control Plane via CLI or GUI.
First, expose the `kong-mesh-control-plane` service. Any method is fine, but here we use `NodePort` for simplicity.

```bash
kubectl expose deployment kong-mesh-control-plane \
    -n kong-mesh-system \
    --type=NodePort \
    --name=kongmesh-cp \
    --port 5681

service/kongmesh-cp exposed

kubectl patch service kongmesh-cp \
    --namespace=kong-mesh-system  \
    --type='json' \
    --patch='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/ports/0/nodePort", "value":30001}]'

service/kongmesh-cp patched
```

#### Accessing the Service

Accessing the exposed service will return output like the following:

  ```bash
    curl -sX GET http://<IP address>:30001 | jq
    {
      "hostname": "kong-mesh-control-plane-5d5cb5f55c-h59wb",
      "tagline": "Kong Mesh",
      "product": "Kong Mesh",
      "version": "2.8.2",
      "instanceId": "kong-mesh-control-plane-5d5cb5f55c-h59wb-2875",
      "clusterId": "ed1a75f5-caf5-4749-943b-0ad7c6c7a49d",
      "gui": "/gui",
      "basedOnKuma": "2.8.2"
    }
  ```

#### Accessing the GUI

Add `/gui` to the exposed service URL to access the GUI interface.

#### Accessing from kumactl

You can also check the Kong Mesh Control Plane from the `kumactl` command.
First, add the Control Plane information to kumactl.

```bash
kumactl config control-planes add \
    --name=kongmesh-cp \
    --address=http://18.178.66.113:30001 --overwrite
added Control Plane "kongmesh-cp"
switched active Control Plane to "kongmesh-cp"
```

You can check the current mesh settings with `kumactl get meshes`.

```bash
kumactl get meshes
NAME      mTLS   METRICS   LOGGING   TRACING   LOCALITY   ZONEEGRESS   AGE
default   off    off       off       off       off        off          9h
```

### Adding an App to Kong Mesh

Add the label `kuma.io/sidecar-injection: enabled` to the resource's `metadata.labels` to add it to Kong Mesh. In the example below, the label is added to the Namespace, so all Pods in this Namespace will have a sidecar (DP) added and be managed by Kong Mesh.

#### Deploying the App

Save the following demo YAML file. The Front End service displays the page, and the Redis service stores the counterâ€”a simple app.

    port: 5000
```

Use the saved YAML file to add the demo resources.

```bash
kubectl apply -f counterapp.yaml
namespace/kuma-demo created
deployment.apps/redis created
service/redis created
deployment.apps/demo-app created
deployment.apps/demo-app-v2 created
service/demo-app created

kubectl get pod -n kuma-demo
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo-app-5db8dc7c7c-5lxv4     2/2     Running   0          31s
demo-app-v2-977f89977-szv4p   2/2     Running   0          31s
redis-b95455698-hk7sm         2/2     Running   0          31s
```

You can see that each Pod has two containers, indicating that the Sidecar has been added.

You can also check this in the GUI under `Data Plane Proxies`.

You can also check the currently managed Sidecars (dataplanes) with the kumactl command.

```bash
kumactl inspect dataplanes

### Publishing the App

Let's try accessing the app. There are several ways, but here we'll use the Gateway + Ingress method.

#### Install gateway

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/standard-install.yaml

customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io created

gatewayclass.gateway.networking.k8s.io/kong created
gateway.gateway.networking.k8s.io/kong created

```

### Install Kong KIC and Ingress

```bash
kubectl create ns kong
kubectl label ns kong kuma.io/sidecar-injection='enabled'
helm install kong kong/ingress -n kong
WARNING: Kubernetes configuration file is group-readable. This is insecure. Location: /home/ubuntu/.kube/config

REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None

cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - 
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1

  namespace: kuma-demo
  annotations:

            name: demo-app
            port:
              number: 5000
EOF
```

Now you can access the deployed APP via the Kong-gateway-proxy.

```bash
kubectl get svc -n kong
NAME                                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                         AGE
kong-controller-validation-webhook   ClusterIP      10.43.225.243   <none>        443/TCP                         3m10s
kong-gateway-admin                   ClusterIP      None            <none>        8444/TCP                        3m10s
kong-gateway-manager                 NodePort       10.43.69.48     <none>        8002:32047/TCP,8445:31615/TCP   3m10s
kong-gateway-proxy                   LoadBalancer   10.43.97.252    <pending>     80:32333/TCP,443:31081/TCP      3m10s
```

Access the app via port `32333`.
Click Increment, and everything should work fine.

## Leveraging Kong Mesh Policies

This is where Kong Mesh really shines. Kong Mesh policies support setting rules for security, access control, and traffic management in a service mesh environment. The main elements of these policies are:

1. **Security Policy**: Enhances security between microservices through encryption (mTLS), authentication, and authorization. Ensures traffic is securely transmitted.
2. **Traffic Policy**: Defines communication rules between services. Manages retries, timeouts, traffic shaping, load balancing, etc.
3. **Authorization Policy**: Controls which services or users can access which resources based on RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
4. **Audit Policy**: Records system-wide activities and generates audit logs, enabling early detection of anomalies or security incidents.

Kong Mesh policies aim to improve the security, performance, and reliability of distributed systems through these features.
[https://docs.konghq.com/mesh/latest/policies/introduction/](https://docs.konghq.com/mesh/latest/policies/introduction/)

Here, we'll explain how to build a Zero Trust network by applying the following two policies:
[https://docs.konghq.com/mesh/latest/policies/meshpassthrough/](https://docs.konghq.com/mesh/latest/policies/meshpassthrough/)
[https://docs.konghq.com/mesh/latest/policies/meshtrafficpermission/](https://docs.konghq.com/mesh/latest/policies/meshtrafficpermission/)

### Building a Zero-trust Network

#### Enabling mTLS

By default, mTLS is disabled.

```bash
kumactl get meshes
NAME      mTLS   METRICS   LOGGING   TRACING   LOCALITY   ZONEEGRESS   AGE
default   off    off       off       off       off        off          9h
```

Kong Mesh has a built-in CA, so you can enable it easily as follows:

```bash
# config mesh to enable mtls
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - 
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: Mesh
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    enabledBackend: ca-1
    backends:
    - name: ca-1
      type: builtin
EOF

kumactl get meshes
NAME      mTLS           METRICS   LOGGING   TRACING   LOCALITY   ZONEEGRESS   AGE
default   builtin/ca-1   off       off       off       off        off          9h
```

Once mTLS is enabled, all traffic requires `meshtrafficpermission`. Since we haven't created any yet, access to the APP should fail.

Depending on the Kong Mesh version, it may not failâ€”this is because an `allow-all` `meshtrafficpermission` exists by default.

#### Allowing Access Between Microservices

For example, creating an `allow-all` permission will keep all traffic in the mesh working as usual.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshTrafficPermission
metadata:
  name: allow-all
  namespace: kong-mesh-system
  labels:
    kuma.io/mesh: default
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: Mesh
  from:
  - targetRef:
      kind: Mesh
    default:
      action: Allow
EOF
```

Let's set permissions at the microservice level for more control.
First, set permission from the Front End Kong Gateway service to the APP.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshTrafficPermission
metadata:
  name: kong2frontend
  namespace: kong-mesh-system
  labels:
    kuma.io/mesh: default
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: MeshService
    name: demo-app_kuma-demo_svc_5000
  from:
  - targetRef:
      kind: MeshSubset
      tags:
        kuma.io/service: kong-gateway-admin_kong_svc_8444
    default:
      action: Allow
EOF
meshtrafficpermission.kuma.io/kong2frontend created
```

Next, set permission from the APP to Redis.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshTrafficPermission
metadata:
  name: frontend2backend
  namespace: kong-mesh-system
  labels:
    kuma.io/mesh: default
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: MeshService
    name: redis_kuma-demo_svc_6379
  from:
  - targetRef:
      kind: MeshSubset
      tags:
        kuma.io/service: demo-app_kuma-demo_svc_5000
    default:
      action: Allow
EOF
```

With this, microservice-level access permissions are set, and the application should work normally.

## Summary

Kong Mesh is a platform that simplifies service mesh management, enabling secure and efficient communication between microservices. This article explains how to deploy Kong Mesh and use its policies.

1. **Preparing the K8s Environment**: Set up a Kubernetes environment using k3s.
2. **Deploying Kong Mesh**:
   - Deploy the Kong Mesh Control Plane using `kumactl`.
   - Expose the Control Plane with `NodePort` and access it via CLI or GUI.
3. **Deploying the Application**:
   - Add the `kuma.io/sidecar-injection: enabled` label to add sidecars to Pods in the Namespace.
   - Deploy Redis and the demo app, and manage them with Kong Mesh.
4. **Publishing the Application**:
   - Use Gateway and Ingress to publish the application.
5. **Leveraging Kong Mesh Policies**:
   - Enable mTLS to build a Zero Trust Network.
   - Set `MeshTrafficPermission` to control access between microservices.

Through this process, you can learn how to build a secure and efficient service mesh using Kong Mesh and manage traffic with policies.
