Due to work, I needed to verify the procedure for renewing certificates on an expired Kubernetes cluster.
Since I hadn't done this before, I'm recording the process here.

## Modify and Build kubeadm Source

0. Install go and git on the build environment, and add go's binary path to PATH.

1. Download the Kubernetes source code. This time, I used v1.18.18.

   ```git clone -b v1.18.18 https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes```

2. Modify the following files to set the certificate validity to 10 minutes:

   ```sh
   diff --git a/cmd/kubeadm/app/constants/constants.go b/cmd/kubeadm/app/constants/constants.go
   index b56891ca908..eed934280e7 100644

   certFixturePath := path.Join(fixtureDirectory, baseName+".crt")
   ```

3. Build only kubeadm with the following command:

   ```make WHAT=cmd/kubeadm GOFLAGS=-v```

   After the build completes, an _output folder will be created, and the kubeadm binary will be in the bin subdirectory.
   If you use this binary to deploy a cluster, the certificate validity will be 10 minutes.

## Checking & Renewing Certificates

1. Build a 3-node cluster and confirm the certificates have about 4 minutes left:

   ````bash

   [check-expiration] Reading configuration from the cluster...
   [check-expiration] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'

2. After expiration, kubectl get node fails:

   root@wenhan-adm-cp:~# kubectl get node
   Unable to connect to the server: x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid
   ```

3. Renew the certificates and confirm the new expiration:

   ```bash
   root@wenhan-adm-cp:~# ./kubeadm alpha certs renew all --config=kubeadm.yaml
   W0624 06:04:00.447612   2860 configset.go:202] WARNING: kubeadm cannot validate component configs for API groups [kubelet.config.k8s.io kubeproxy.config.k8s.io]
   certificate embedded in the kubeconfig file for the admin to use and for kubeadm itself renewed

   certificate the apiserver uses to access etcd renewed
   certificate for the API server to connect to kubelet renewed
   certificate embedded in the kubeconfig file for the controller manager to use renewed

   certificate for etcd nodes to communicate with each other renewed
   certificate for serving etcd renewed
   certificate for the front proxy client renewed
   certificate embedded in the kubeconfig file for the scheduler manager to use renewed
   ```

   After renewal, the expiration of each certificate is updated:

   ```bash
   root@wenhan-adm-cp:~# ./kubeadm alpha certs check-expiration
   [check-expiration] Reading configuration from the cluster...
   [check-expiration] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'

   front-proxy-ca      Jun 24, 2021 07:31 UTC  1h        no
   ```

4. After renewing the certificates, restart the control plane:

   ```bash
   root@wenhan-adm-cp:~# reboot
   ```

   This completes the certificate renewal.

   After rebooting, you can access the cluster with the new authentication files:

   ```bash
   root@wenhan-adm-cp:~# cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
   cp: overwrite '/root/.kube/config'? yes
   
   root@wenhan-adm-cp:~# kubectl get node
   NAME       STATUS  ROLES   AGE  VERSION
   wenhan-adm-cp   Ready   master  14m  v1.18.18
   wenhan-adm-wk1  Ready   <none>  13m  v1.18.18
   wenhan-adm-wk2  Ready   <none>  13m  v1.18.18
   ```
